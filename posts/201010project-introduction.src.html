<html><body><p>With the project <em><em><strong>Euglena </strong></em></em>I want to build a Lego NXT robot to find light. The name "Euglena" comes from the single-cell organism which can sense light and swim to it.<br><br>The sensor I am using is the light sensorÂ  and maybe also the ultrasonic sensor to avoid collision.<br><br>I will put all the programs and building instruction here, so that people who interested can reproduce it.</p></body></html>
