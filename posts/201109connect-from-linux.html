<html><body><p>Bought a very cheap Asus X54L laptop two weeks ago. I installed Ubuntu 11.04 on it. Cause there is no bluetooth adapter on the laptop I boughtÂ <a href="http://www.amazon.de/LogiLink-Bluetooth-USB-Adapter-Class2-V2-0/dp/B0019D1LSW/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1317413780&amp;sr=8-4">LogiLink Bluetooth USB-Adapter Class2 EDR V2.0</a> on Amazon.de. It only costs about 3 Euros and works well with Lego NXT.<br><br>I basically followed <a href="http://www.mindstorms.rwth-aachen.de/trac/wiki/Download4.04">RWTH Mindstorms NXT toolbox instructions</a> to successfully connect to Lego NXT without much difficulty. The only problem is for some unknown reason I need to connect twice with btconnect command provided by the toolbox to let Matlab recognize NXT.</p></body></html>
